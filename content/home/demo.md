How does your town spend taxpayer money? Can you find out what your representatives discussed at  town council meetings? How does your town's transparency compare to other local governments? 


At [MIT](https://www.mit.edu) [GOV/LAB](https://mitgovlab.org), we've used predictive modeling to assign transparency scores to local governments across the United States. While most will agree that government transparency is important, measuring transparency for a large number of governments can be costly and time-intensive. Using  big data [methods](methodology/methodology/), we were able to grade thousands of town websites on whether they contain basic information about how your government operates.
